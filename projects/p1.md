# Inventory Management System - React Frontend

## Project Description

In this project, you will develop a modern web application frontend using React that connects to your previously built Java SQL REST API backend for inventory management. This application will allow users to manage products through an intuitive user interface. You will apply fundamental React concepts, TypeScript integration, and proper connection to your custom backend service.

## Technology Stack

- **Core Framework**: React
- **JavaScript Superset**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with ShadCN UI components
- **Routing**: TanStack Router
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Version Control**: Git

## Project Requirements

The project should include:

1. A multi-page inventory management application using TanStack Router
2. TypeScript integration throughout the application
3. Properly implemented CORS policy for API communication
4. Responsive design using TailwindCSS and ShadCN components
5. Connection to your custom Java SQL REST API using Axios
6. CRUD operations for products using TanStack Query
7. Product search and filtering functionality
8. Form validation and error handling
9. Test coverage with Jest and React Testing Library

## User Stories
