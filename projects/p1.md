# Inventory Management System - React Frontend

## Project Description

In this project, you will develop a modern web application frontend using React that connects to your previously built Java SQL REST API backend for inventory management. This application will allow users to manage products through an intuitive user interface. You will apply fundamental React concepts, TypeScript integration, and proper connection to your custom backend service.

## Technology Stack

- **Core Framework**: React
- **JavaScript Superset**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Routing**: React Router
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

## Project Requirements

The project should include:

1. A multi-page inventory management application using React Router
2. TypeScript integration throughout the application
3. Properly implemented CORS policy for API communication
4. Responsive design using TailwindCSS
5. Connection to your custom Java SQL REST API
6. CRUD operations for products
7. Product search and filtering functionality
8. Form validation and error handling
9. Test coverage with Jest and React Testing Library
